    #See files and folders of current directory
        ls
        ls -alh :see file size, type, modify(maybe it is creation) date
            -a - show all files, even hidden ones
            -l - show file size in bytes
            -h - "human readable" - convert the bytes to Kb, Mb, or Gb
    #Access directory
        cd directory_name (tab auto complete directory name)
    #Access home directory
        cd
    #Print working directory
        pwd

[[ Files and Directories ]]
    #Make new directory
        mkdir <directory name>
    #Move file from old directory to new directory and rename it
        mv dir1/filename1 dir2/filename2
    #Rename file without moving
        rename - mv old_name new_name
    #Copy file into directory
        cp file_name Directory
    #Remove
        rm file_name (remove file from current directory)
        rm -r directory_name (CAUTION!! there is no undo - remove directory)
    #Counting
        count number of lines in file: wc -l file_name
        count number of words in file: wc -w file_name
    #Make a sample file
        sample file from beginning of file: head -n(some_number) file1_name > output_file_name
        sample file from end of file: tail -n(some_number) file1_name > output_file_name
    #View file without opening entire file
        less file_name
        less navigation: ***THESE MIGHT BE WRONG DOUBLE CHECK***
            go to line: :line_number
            search: /search_pattern
                next instance: n
                previous instance: p
            jump pages: space_bar

[[ Pipeing ]]
    #Output one command to another command 
        command1 | command2
        ex1. head -n1 file_name | less
        ex2. head -n1 file_name | sed 's/,/\t/g' | less
    #(over)Write file
        command > file_name
    #Append to file
        command >> file_name
    #Edit a file directly from standard-in
        cat filename.txt | vi -

[[ Help ]]
    #Getting help on a command
        man command
        ex1. man woman
