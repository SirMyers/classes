Overview of the data we are collecting
    Baseline data sets:
        Well Defined sets: 

            Neighborhood  boundaries
            City Boundaries
            Ward/Council districts
            School districts (school board districts and attendance zones)**
            Parcels
            Park Boundaries
            Voting Precints

            Police Districts/Precincts
            311 Data
            Crime Data 
            Zoning Districts
            Special Tax Districts
            Fire Districts/Emergency Service Zones
            Permit data?

    Why do we want these?:
        Adds value to our product
        The more robust it is the more we have to offer
        Predictive modeling with data
            shape files work as containers that we can aggregate our data
            tabular data like 311 becomes a part of the data sets for predictive modeling

    Collection overview:
        5 MSAs and 10 major cities
        5 MSAs (TBD)
            80% of population coverage per MSA or cap at 150 cities per MSA
            working in clusters of cities; bordering cities should be prioritized 
                ie; Philladelphia and all clustered cities 
            (tentative MSAs) New York, DC, Chicago, Los Angeles,***Philadelphia**  
        10 Major cities (TBD)
            Gather complete data sets for these cities

    Types of files (show exaples):

        (see one pager from Wize)
        WE WANT:
            .shp - main file that stores the feature geometry; no attribues, only geometry
            .shx - companion file to the .shp; stores position of individual IDs in the .shp file
            .dbf - dBASE table that stores the attribute information of features
