Research training program outline

Day1

[[ Overview of what we are doing ]]
    Data collection in desired 5 MSAs and top 10 cities
        What is an MSA?
            census glossary: https://www.census.gov/glossary/
        15 cities in each MSA - map of cities
            clusters around the city with highest population

[[ Overview of the data we are collecting ]]
    [[ Baseline data sets: ]]
        Well Defined sets: 

            Neighborhood  boundaries
            City Boundaries
            Ward/Council districts
            School districts (school board districts and attendance zones)**
            Parcels
            Park Boundaries
            Voting Precints

            Police Districts/Precincts
            311 Data
            Crime Data 
            Zoning Districts
            Special Tax Districts
            Fire Districts/Emergency Service Zones
            Permit data?

    Why do we want these?:
        Adds value to our product
        The more robust it is the more we have to offer
        Predictive modeling with data
            shape files work as containers that we can aggregate our data
            tabular data like 311 becomes a part of the data sets for predictive modeling

    [[ Collection overview: ]]
        5 MSAs and 10 major cities
            7 week sprint to collect as many data sets per MSA and TCs as possible
            1 week to sure up anything that is missing (if needed)
            1 week to sprint though anything additional
            (Subject to change as we move through)        
        5 MSAs
            working in clusters of cities; bordering cities should be prioritized 
                ie; Philladelphia and all clustered cities 
            (tentative MSAs) New York, DC, Chicago, Los Angeles,Philadelphia 
        10 Major cities
            Gather complete data sets for these cities
        Most of efforts will be put towards MSAs
            Number of cities in any given MSA

    [[ Types of files (exaples): ]]
    http://www.pasda.psu.edu/uci/SearchResults.aspx?searchType=originator&originator=City%20of%20Philadelphia&sessionID=3437416642015513161553
        (see one pager from Wize)
        WE WANT:
            .shp - main file that stores the feature geometry; no attribues, only geometry
            .shx - companion file to the .shp; stores position of individual IDs in the .shp file
            .dbf - dBASE table that stores the attribute information of features

Day2

Overview of collection/storage, linux, and prelim research 

    [[ Collection & Storage: ]]
        Outline how to track collection progress
            go over tracking excel sheet
        Expectations for tracking
            Will be on z-drive 
            Update sheet for city when data is collected
            Should be part of daily checks 
        Moving data to z-drive
            discuss structure of storage
                how and where to store info
            discuss communication channels as data is uploaded
                what happens with the raw data
                where and how is it cleaned?

    [[ Data integrity terms: ]]
        Clean - taking out bad values, characters, adjusting rows,..

        Standardize - adjusting to fit to scale - all values should add up to 1 if they donâ€™t find them up to one

        Normalize - recombine and restructure database columns/tables 
            
    High level linux training
        https://automatetheboringstuff.com/?utm_source=hackernewsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_term=books
        Understand intern's familiarity with command line and linux commands
        Discuss items in the Linux_class file 6 put together
            share how it could be useful to use

    Research together
        Go into a city as a group (city TBD)
        Start looking for data sets
        Discuss some ideas of generic searches
            Priority search - last resort search
        Download data sets (if found)
            upload to z-drive
            go through tracking process
        Find contacts if cannot find data sets
            go through process of gathering contact info and sending out requests 

Day3

Recap, more linux if interested, individual research
    
    Recap:
        why we are gathering this data
        what we hope to accomplish with the data
        where we are targeting
        collection process
        storage and tracking process
        flow between teems (gis, eng, rea)

    linux (if interested):
        refresh on previous day's linux lesson
        go over more exaples of using the command line
            navigation
            directories and files
            revisit linux cheat sheet (get from 6) 

    Independent research:
        Focus on one city from one of the MSAs
            go through the process of researching, collecting, storing, and tracking independently
            (assist and answer questions as needed)

???Assessment???
    Describe why we want to collect these data sets.

    What are 2 of the MSAs and 2 major cites we are going into?

    What types of files are acceptable from a GIS standpoint?

    Describe the flow between the three teams (Rea, GIS, Eng).

    Where is the data and tracking sheet stored?

    Describe how you can start searching for a citie's GIS data.
